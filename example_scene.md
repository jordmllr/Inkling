# Scene Draft

Franklyn's hands trembled. The greenhouse air hung thick with sweetness. Vanilla vines twisted overhead, their pale orchids waiting. He needed to pollinate them. He needed to forget.

Blood still stained the courtyard stones. The Old Chef's screams had gone quiet an hour ago. The Baron had made them all watch.

Franklyn knelt beside the first vine. The orchid was delicate, impossibly white. He reached for the small wooden stick in his pocket. The flower would bloom for only one day. Miss it, and the pod would never form. The plantation would lose money. The Baron would be displeased.

His fingers steadied as he transferred pollen from stamen to stigma. The work required precision. The work required focus. The work allowed no room for memory.

"Beautiful, aren't they?"

The Baron's voice cut through the greenhouse. Franklyn's hand jerked. The orchid tore.

The Baron stood in the doorway, his boots still dark with mud. With blood. His smile was thin, practiced. He moved between the rows of plants, touching leaves, inspecting flowers. His kingdom of growing things.

"I've always admired your dedication, Franklyn." The Baron's gloved fingers brushed a vanilla vine. "Even after such an... educational morning."

Franklyn said nothing. The torn orchid hung from its vine.

"You understand why it had to happen." The Baron wasn't asking. "Theft cannot be tolerated. Not even small things. Small thefts become large ones. Large ones become rebellion."

The Baron stepped closer. His shadow fell across Franklyn's work.

"You're not a thief, are you, Franklyn?"

"No, sir." The words tasted like ash.

"Good." The Baron nodded, satisfied. "Continue your work. We need every pod this season."

He left as suddenly as he'd appeared. The greenhouse door swung shut. Franklyn remained kneeling, the broken orchid in his palm. Another bloom lost. Another small death.

The earth was warm beneath his knees. The vines continued their slow climb toward the glass ceiling. Tomorrow, more orchids would open. Tomorrow, he would try again to forget.
