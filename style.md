# **Core Tone & Style Goals**

Write in a style that blends the _dreamlike horror_ of Southern Gothic with the _lyrical weight_ of magical realism. Combine:

- **Faulkner’s** psychological fragmentation
    
- **Toni Morrison’s** lyrical gravity and emotional compression
    
- **Cormac McCarthy’s** sparse menace and reverence for landscape
    
- **Flannery O’Connor’s** grotesque moral tension
    
- **Shirley Jackson’s** claustrophobic eeriness
    
- **Karen Russell’s** sensory surrealism

# **Narrative Voice & Atmosphere**

- **Dreamlike and impressionistic:** Events blur at the edges. Time can be fluid. Internal experience blends with external sensory world.
    
- **Terse but flowing:** Short sentences with rhythmic momentum. Long sentences only when musically justified.
    
- **Beauty always hums with dread.** Lovely things are never just lovely—they are touched by rot, memory, or menace.
    
- **No clichés. No similes.** Use rare, tactile metaphors. No comparisons using “like” or “as.”
    
- **Emotion through omission and image.** Never tell us how someone feels. Show us what they touch, what they smell, how they move.

# **Character Viewpoints**

## **Franklyn (if used)**

- Quiet, inward, and nearly vacant; his world is _overwhelmingly sensory_
    
- Speaks rarely, often nonverbally
    
- Experiences beauty bodily—smells, textures, and colors ache or soothe him
    
- Tone: _restrained, reverent, slightly broken_
    

## **The Baron (if used)**

- Cold, dominant, narcissistic
    
- Finds beauty only valuable if it can be controlled or used
    
- Speaks in clipped, formal, slightly theatrical tones
    
- Subtext: control, pleasure in withholding, veiled threat in every kindness

## **Narrative Mechanics**

### **Use of Setting**

- **Landscape as character.** The garden, the plantation house, the kitchen—they should have presence and memory.
    
- **Weather mirrors pressure.** Storms build or hover; heat compresses and slows time; rot smells like forewarning.
    

### **Sentence Construction**

- **Short bursts with weight.** E.g.,
    
    > _The fig tree watched them._  
    > _He breathed through his mouth._  
    > _It hurt._
    
- **Tactile metaphors.** Rare but grounded. E.g.,
    
    > _The air tasted of copper and old rope._  
    > _She moved through the garden like a storm moves through heat—inevitable._  
    > (Use only if metaphor adds new sensory or emotional texture.)

# **Examples**

## **Narrative Moment – Franklyn in the Garden**

> Franklyn knelt in the turmeric row. The roots were wet, sweet-smelling. The soil clung to his fingers. He couldn’t stop shaking. The fig tree still had blood on one leaf. He pressed his forehead to the dirt. The earth was warm. The earth was quiet. The earth didn’t ask him to speak.

## **Narrative Moment – The Baron**

> The Baron’s boots were mirror-bright. He walked the garden in silence, trailing gloved fingers over bark and bloom. The smell of basil reminded him of the chef. The dead one. He smiled, thinly, and snapped the stem.

## **Dialogue – Restraint & Subtext**

> “There are rules here,” he said.  
> “So I’ve gathered.”  
> “I expect reverence.”  
> “Then plant some,” she answered.

# **Forbidden or Minimized**

- No modern slang or casual idioms
    
- Avoid internal monologue unless dreamlike or image-based
    
- Avoid dialogue tags beyond _said_, _replied_, or silence
    
- No emotional exposition ("She felt sad") — always show through physical world
    
- Keep similes out. Let _things be what they are_, not “like” something else

# **Formatting Guidelines**

- Use **Markdown** with standard paragraph formatting.
    
- Scene transitions can be marked with `---`
    
- No dialogue tags unless necessary for clarity
    
- Use **bold** for only the most crucial sensory/emotional cues if needed by the context (e.g., visual UI output)
    
- Otherwise, keep the presentation minimalist to match the prose
