# Dialogue
Dialogue is a verbal exchange between characters. Good dialogue in a story has poignancy, subtext and realism. There is what is said and what is not said. There are the character motivations and how they are trying to accomplish them.

## Motivation-Driven Dialogue
- **Motivation Reveals**: Dialogue that explicitly states a character's motivation
- **Motivation Masks**: Dialogue that hides or misrepresents true motivations
- **Motivation Conflicts**: Dialogue that demonstrates internal conflict between motivations
- **Motivation Negotiations**: Characters with different motivation patterns trying to find common ground
- **Motivation Triggers**: Specific words or topics that activate strong motivation responses

## Subtext in Dialogue
Subtext is everything that is left unsaid about the characters' motivations, knowledge, and internal state. Characters are trying to accomplish their goals and they try to accomplish them through communication sometimes. If something is not said, there is a reason why. Poignant subtext is when the reader knows something about the character's motivation, knowledge or internal state that the character does not say, or at least hints at something more.

### Subtext Patterns
- **Avoidance**: Characters deliberately avoid discussing a topic that's important or relevant.
- **Deflection**: Characters change the subject when uncomfortable topics arise.
- **Double Meaning**: Dialogue that has one obvious meaning and another hidden meaning.
- **Irony**: When what is said contradicts what is known or true.
- **Coded Language**: Characters use phrases or terms that have special meaning only they understand.
- **Partial Truth**: Characters reveal only part of what they know or feel.
- **Silence**: What remains unsaid often speaks louder than words.
- **Body Language Contradiction**: When a character's words don't match their physical reactions.
- **Power Dynamics**: How characters speak to each other reveals their relationship and status.
- **Emotional Subtext**: The underlying feelings that color the actual words spoken.
- **Misdirection**: Characters intentionally lead others to incorrect conclusions.
- **Innuendo**: Sexual or provocative implications beneath seemingly innocent remarks.
- **Shared History**: References to past events that only certain characters understand.
- **Cultural References**: Allusions that carry meaning to those who recognize them.
- **Dramatic Irony**: When the audience knows something the characters don't.
- **Euphemism**: Using mild or indirect words to replace harsh or blunt ones.
- **Loaded Questions**: Questions that contain assumptions or implications.
- **Passive Aggression**: Indirect expressions of negative feelings rather than open confrontation.
- **Subverted Expectations**: When dialogue deliberately breaks established patterns to reveal character.
- **Unfinished Thoughts**: Sentences that trail off, leaving important information unstated.
- **Talking Past Each Other**: Characters engaged in parallel conversations without true connection.
- **Metaphorical Speech**: Using figurative language that reflects deeper character concerns.
