### Motivation Interaction Patterns

  - Example: Power and Recognition nodes both satisfied by a promotion

  - Example: Security needs overriding Meaning pursuits during crisis
- **Evolving Motivations**: When motivation priorities shift over time
  - Example: Achievement giving way to Meaning as a character ages
- **Unconscious Motivations**: Drives that influence behavior without the character's awareness
  - Example: Childhood trauma creating an unconscious Security node
- **Projected Motivations**: When a character attributes their own motivations to others
  - Example: A power-motivated character assuming others are also motivated by power
- **Thwarted Motivations**: When a character's core motivation is repeatedly blocked
