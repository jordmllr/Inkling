The plantation was founded by an eccentric billionaire before anteruinam(before the collapse / pre apocalypse). He believed that the world was going to end and in the aftermath there would need to be beauty in the world. He had inherited a large estate in the deep south and began collecting treasures from around the world, but also building the spice plantation - a complex of outside gardens and massive earth-bermed greenhouses that help moderate the heat outside.

In particular, the gardens not only had to be productive but also beautiful: companion planting and intercropping into lush and mazelike interior and exterior gardens. The founder was a madman, but also a genius.

The founder was the Baron's great-great-grandfather
