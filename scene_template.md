A scene should begin with a template that outlines its goals. What happens in this scene that matters to the story? how is that information conveyed using metaphor, sensory details, character actions, or subtext?

Example
**Scene Goals:**  
[x] Show Franklyn tending the garden after the execution  
[x] Suggest his guilt and trauma through sensory immersion  
[x] Hint that the Baron is watching, unseen  
```
