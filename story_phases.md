# Phases of Narrative Development
Inklings has three phases of narrative development: discovery, development, and delivery. Writers don't move linearly through each one, but rather, do different work in each one. It's a way to give ideas and thoughts a place to go.

## 1. Discovery
The discovery phase is the collection of ideas and thoughts and fragments that help me understand what it is I'm trying to write. The outcome of this phase is decisions made about characters, threads, plot, and themes. This won't be a whole story, but it will provide the points that being to outline one, like a constellation.

## 2. Development
For story elements that have graduated to the development phase, we begin to interrogate them more deeply. This is where we begin to build out the story in more detail. Why does this character want to do X? This thread has no clear inciting incident. THe ultimate outcome of the development phase is to create a set of scenes with detailed goals and notes for each one explaining why it's in the story, what needs to happen for the plot, and the character motivations that drive their internal decisions and external actions. The scenes are not written, rather they have an annotated outline.

## 3. Delivery
The delivery phase considers how to tell the story developed in the development phase. This is where we consider the style, voice, and tone of the story. Who is the viewpoint character in this scene? What imagery and sensory details will be used to evoke the emotional state of the characters and audience? How will the dialogue be written; what subtext will make the dialogue compelling? The delivery phase is also where we begin to consider the structure of the story, and how the scenes fit together to form a cohesive whole.
